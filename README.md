We develop clustering algorithms and Bayesian graphical models to spoof human biometric patterns in mobile inputs. We frame this as a targeted adversarial attack generation problem, and the applications are twofold. First, by developing methods to generate a mass of adversarial examples, we can develop more robust discriminatory classifiers for enhanced security in sensitive environments such as biometric identification on smartphones. Second, our vector mapping heuristics transform generated examples to time-sequence data, which can be employed to augment sparse datasets and develop emulators of fine-grained human behavior.
